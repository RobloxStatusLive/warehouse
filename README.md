### The Roblox Status Live Data Storage Warehouse
#### Written by iiPython and Crcoli737
***
### ⚡Overview
Warehouse is the Roblox Status Live data storing service. It connects to the Nebula front-end, which is what the site visitors actually see, think of Warehouse as the supplier for a grocery store. When you walk up and down the aisles and through the check-out line, you are looking at the front-end (Nebula) but what you don't see, is the supplying of all of those items, which is what Warehouse does. 

In technical terms, Warehouse reaches out and contacts the Roblox APIs and stores the data recieved by them, checks if the information is accurate, checks the response codes, and measures the ping times. All of this data is put into a database which is also monitored and maintained by Warehouse for Nebula (or other third-party applications) to call for the data.

Nebula and Warehouse go hand and hand, if it weren't for Warehouse, Nebula would have no data to supply to the visitor or third-party apps. If it weren't for Nebula, there wouldn't be a use for all of the data that Warehouse is compiling.
